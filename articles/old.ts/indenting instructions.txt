### Indentation Instructions for Articles

Please format the `content` string in the TypeScript article file using the following exact indentation rules (spaces only, no tabs):

- **Top-level numbered clauses (1., 2., etc.)**: 0 leading spaces before the number.
- **Letter subclauses (a), b), c), etc.)**: exactly 6 spaces before the letter.
- **Roman-numeral subclauses (i), ii), iii), etc.)**: exactly 12 spaces before the roman numeral.
- **Parenthesised subclauses ((i), (ii), etc.)**: exactly 18 spaces before the parenthesis.
- **Continuation lines** (wrapped text after a clause marker): align visually under the start of the text on the line above (usually 8–10 spaces for top-level, 14–16 for letter level, 20–22 for roman, 26–28 for parenthesised — adjust slightly for readability so long lines hang neatly).
- **Unnumbered introductory paragraphs** (e.g., before section 1 or transitional text): 0 leading spaces.
- **Closing unnumbered paragraphs and signature** (after the numbered sections): 0 leading spaces.
- **Blank lines** between major sections or paragraphs: preserve exactly one blank line (i.e., two `\n` in the template literal).
- Use `.trim()` at the end of the template literal to remove leading/trailing whitespace from the whole string.

Example snippet of desired structure:

```
1.     Top-level clause text...

2.     Another top-level...
      a)     Letter subclause text that may wrap
            onto continuation lines aligned here...
      b)     Next letter...

3.     Third top-level...
      a)     ...
            i)      Roman subclause...
           ii)     Next roman...

Unnumbered closing paragraph with 0 spaces...
