  "content": "Article 2 – Freedom of Inquiry and Redress\n\n1.     The pursuit of knowledge in history, biology, psychology, medicine, anthropology, genetics, physics, and every other branch of learning, sciences, philosophy, religion or general elaboration is an inviolable extension of freedom of thought and expression.\n2.     No authority, whether legislative, judicial, administrative, academic, educational, professional, or corporate, may forbid, restrict, defund, deplatform, penalise, or in any way impede research, publication, teaching, or open discussion because the subject matter, methodology, or conclusions are deemed controversial, unorthodox, harmful to public policy, or politically or scientifically unacceptable.\n3.     All existing statutes, regulations, disciplinary codes, and precedents that have been used to suppress inquiry in the biological, psychological, historical, medical, philosophical, religious, or any other field of elaboration on ideological grounds are hereby abolished in perpetuity.\n4.     Petition of Redress\nAny citizen may file a Petition of Redress challenging any publicly funded or publicly enforced claim, dataset, interpretation, model, consensus, or paradigm that materially affects law, regulation, public expenditure, education, professional practice, or the rights guaranteed in this Constitution.\nUpon receipt of a petition supported by at least five hundred citizen signatures and a prima-facie written argument not exceeding fifty pages, the Supreme Court shall empanel a Special Tribunal of Scientific Review consisting of seventeen members and governed by the procedures set forth in the subsections below.\nPetitions which cover largely the same subject matter shall be heard on a first-come, first-served basis. If a prior petition results in an Overturn decision, all subsequent queued petitions challenging the same claim on substantially similar grounds shall be dismissed as moot, without need for further hearing.\na)     Composition\nThe Tribunal shall consist of:\ni)      three senior judges chosen by lot, who serve under their normal judicial identity and jointly preside;\nii)     seven highly qualified citizens defined as those holding at least a baccalaureate or equivalent degree in a field generally relevant but not specific to the petition, chosen by blind lot from the National Registry of Qualified Experts; and\niii)   seven lay citizens aged twenty-five or older, possessing at minimum a high-school diploma or equivalent demonstrated literacy, and having no criminal record for crimes of dishonesty, chosen by blind lot from the National Registry of Citizens.\nService on a Special Tribunal is a compulsory civic duty for those selected, equivalent to jury duty. Selected experts and lay members shall receive full salary replacement from the state for the duration of the proceedings plus a per-diem honourarium equal to twice the national median daily wage. Refusal to serve without grave cause (certified medical incapacity or extreme hardship) is punishable by a fine of one year’s median wage and permanent disqualification from any future public contract, grant, or academic position funded by the Republic.\nb)     Anonymity and Security\nThe identities of the fourteen non-judicial members shall remain permanently sealed and known only to the Registrar of the Supreme Court. In all proceedings and decisions they shall appear solely under randomly assigned numerical identifiers. Any attempt to discover, publish, or act upon the sealed identities of anonymised members is a felony carrying a mandatory minimum sentence of seven years’ imprisonment.\nThe fourteen anonymized members shall never meet in person, hear each other’s voices, or see each other’s faces at any time through the proceedings, including during the hearing and decision phase.\nAll proceedings shall be conducted through a secure interface that defaults to text-only but permits voice-and-image inputs only if fully scrambled to ensure secure anonymity. Each anonymized member appears solely as their assigned number, with no unscrambled voice or image permitted at any stage.\nc)     Procedure and Decision\nProceedings shall be fully adversarial, equally funded, open to the public, and live-streamed with securely anonymizing voice and image alteration for the fourteen anonymised members.\nAfter the close of evidence and argument, each of the fourteen members shall individually and privately submit a written report (maximum 20 pages) containing their reasoning and provisional vote (Uphold / Overturn / Inconclusive). All fourteen reports are immediately published simultaneously and anonymously to the other panel members and to the public. Each member then has 72 hours to submit optional written rebuttals or revisions (again anonymized). Final binding votes are cast secretly and simultaneously.\nThe decision is determined by simple majority of the seventeen members and may be:\ni)      Uphold: the challenged claim is reaffirmed;\nii)     Overturn: the challenged claim is declared unsupported or falsified; all laws, regulations, curricula, mandates, or public expenditures relying structurally on the overturned claim are automatically suspended nation-wide pending new legislation or pedagogy; or\niii)   Inconclusive: insufficient evidence either way; the status quo remains but the petition is deemed meritorious for future re-challenge.\nIf no single outcome receives the votes of the simple majority of members, the decision shall be recorded as Inconclusive.\nNo decision of the tribunal establishes binding precedent; scientific, philosophical, religious, political, and any other truth or falsehood remains forever contestable.\nThe three senior judges shall jointly preside over the Special Tribunal. They alone possess the authority to rule on admissibility of evidence, enforce decorum, sanction contempt, compel the production of documents or witnesses (including from government departments and corporations), and certify the final report. Any procedural ruling by the judges may be overridden only by a unanimous vote of the remaining fourteen members.\nd)     Limits on Abuse, Re-challenge, and Rewards\nFrivolous or malicious petitions, proven beyond reasonable doubt, may incur reasonable costs but never imprisonment or professional sanction unless fraud is established.\nA decision to Uphold a claim may not be re-challenged on substantially the same grounds for five years from the date of the tribunal’s final report, unless new material evidence is presented that was verifiably unavailable to the original petitioners. A decision to Overturn or declare Inconclusive is final and may be re-challenged at any time by any citizen meeting the ordinary petition requirements.\nIf a petition is rejected as Uphold by a margin of fewer than eleven votes, the original petitioners (or their successors) are granted one cost-free second petition on the same topic without needing new signatures. This right expires two years after the first decision and may not be invoked again on the same claim.\nUpon a final Overturn decision by the Special Tribunal, the lead petitioner(s), limited to qualifying citizens under Article 9, shall receive:\ni)      Automatic reimbursement of all verified costs incurred in preparing and pursuing the petition (e.g., research, signature collection, and administrative expenses), as certified by the Supreme Court; and\nii)     A fixed honorarium equal to seven times the national median annual wage. This remuneration shall be drawn from the budget of the suspended program, law, or expenditure, or, if unavailable, from a dedicated Accountability Fund established by the Treasury under Article 20. No rewards apply to Uphold or Inconclusive decisions.",
  "precis": "Article 2 enshrines freedom of inquiry as an absolute extension of thought and expression, rendering inviolable the pursuit of knowledge across all disciplines—history, biology, psychology, medicine, anthropology, genetics, physics, philosophy, religion, and every other field. No authority may forbid, restrict, defund, deplatform, penalise, or impede research, publication, teaching, or discussion on grounds of controversy, unorthodoxy, or ideological unacceptability. All prior statutes, regulations, codes, and precedents employed to suppress inquiry are abolished forever.\n\nThis provision counters the modern peril of institutional capture and enforced orthodoxy that stifles truth and enables catastrophic error, affirming the European tradition of fearless rational exploration. By removing all barriers, it accelerates discovery, dismantles falsehoods, and ensures governance rests on merit rather than dogma, protecting the Republic against twenty-first-century threats of algorithmic gatekeeping, funding capture, and supranational pseudoscience.\n\nThe Petition of Redress empowers any citizen to challenge publicly funded or enforced claims, datasets, interpretations, models, consensuses, or paradigms affecting law, regulation, expenditure, education, practice, or constitutional rights. Upon a petition with five hundred citizen signatures and a prima-facie argument not exceeding fifty pages, the Supreme Court empanels a Special Tribunal of Scientific Review: three lot-drawn senior judges presiding publicly, seven relevant-degree experts and seven qualified lay citizens selected by blind lot from the respective National Registries, serving compulsorily under permanent identity seal and full procedural anonymity (no in-person contact, unscrambled voice, or visible faces; secure text-default interface only).\n\nProceedings are adversarial, equally funded, public, and live-streamed with anonymizing alteration. Anonymised members submit individual reasoned reports and provisional votes simultaneously for public and panel review, followed by optional rebuttals and secret final ballots. Simple majority determines Uphold, Overturn (suspending reliant laws, regulations, or expenditures nationwide), or Inconclusive outcomes, with no binding precedent—truth remains eternally contestable. Judges rule procedurally but may be overridden unanimously by the fourteen anonymised members.\n\nDuplicate petitions are queued first-come; prior Overturn moots subsequent identical challenges. Uphold decisions bar substantially similar re-challenge for five years absent new unavailable evidence; narrow Uphold margins grant one cost-free re-petition within two years. Frivolous petitions incur reasonable costs only upon proven malice, never imprisonment absent fraud. Successful Overturn rewards qualifying lead petitioners with full cost reimbursement and a fixed honorarium of seven times the national median annual wage, drawn from suspended programs or a dedicated Accountability Fund.\n\nThis mechanism democratises truth-seeking through meritocratic randomisation, shielded participation, and transparent contestation, preventing entrenched error while honouring citizen capacity for discernment. It fortifies the Republic against ideological subversion, ensuring knowledge advances freely to sustain liberty, excellence, and the European heritage for posterity."
