1.     The fertility of Canadian soil and the independence of Canadian farmers are vital to national survival. The state shall protect family farms against corporate consolidation and foreign ownership.

2.     No genetically modified organism, pesticide, herbicide, or agricultural practice proven to degrade soil health or human fertility may be imposed upon farmers or consumers.

3.     Seed saving and the exchange of heirloom varieties are inviolable rights.

4.     The nation shall maintain strategic grain reserves and pursue policies that guarantee food self-sufficiency under all circumstances.

5.     No federal or provincial law, regulation, licence, quota, marketing board, supply-management system, or any other instrument may prohibit or unreasonably restrict the direct sale by family farmers of raw milk and raw-milk products (including cheese, butter, and cream) or their pasteurized equivalents, farm-fresh eggs, meat, poultry, honey, vegetables, fruit, or any other whole, unprocessed food produced on the farm to willing consumers. Simple sanitary guidelines may be issued for the protection of public health, but no pasteurisation mandate, inspection fee regime, production quota, or licensing barrier may be used to suppress or eliminate small-scale or traditional production and direct farm-to-consumer commerce.

6.     All existing supply-management systems, marketing boards, and production quotas that artificially restrict agricultural output or fix prices above open-market levels are abolished within five years of the ratification of this Constitution.

7.     All organs of the Republic, including national and provincial governments, publicly funded institutions, schools, hospitals, correctional facilities, military services, and any entity receiving public funds for food provision, shall give explicit preference to foods produced, processed, and packaged within the territory of the Republic by citizens or merit-proven enterprises, provided such foods meet required standards of quality, safety, and competitive value.
      Procurement policies shall prioritize:
      a)     foods fully sourced from Canadian agriculture and processing;
      b)     family farms and small-to-medium enterprises over consolidated corporate entities, consistent with Section 1 and the anti-monopoly provisions of Article 24;
      c)     nutritional density, freshness, and environmental stewardship in evaluation criteria.
      Exceptions may be granted only for items verifiably unavailable domestically in sufficient quantity or quality, or during declared emergencies. Annual public reports shall detail compliance, economic impact on domestic producers, and progress toward full national self-reliance in essential foodstuffs.

8.     The slaughter of animals for food shall be performed only by methods that ensure instantaneous unconsciousness prior to bleeding. No ritual or religious exemption may be granted that permits the cutting of conscious animals. The traditional European methods of pre-stunning followed by rapid exsanguination are hereby affirmed as the sole lawful standard throughout the Republic.

Article 19 positions agriculture and food sovereignty as pillars of national resilience in the Meritocratic Republic of Canada, honoring the European settlers’ legacy of taming vast lands into bountiful farms that sustained communities through ingenuity and stewardship. In a world where corporate monopolies and global supply chains have rendered nations vulnerable to disruptions, from engineered shortages to biotechnological manipulations, this provision protects family farms from consolidation and foreign ownership, ensuring that the soil’s fertility remains a birthright for competent, merit-driven producers rather than a commodity for distant elites. By banning practices like GMOs or chemicals that harm soil health and human fertility, it secures the freedom of sustainable farming, preventing the crimes of environmental degradation and eugenic sabotage that could undermine the demographic vitality of the citizenry, as seen in recent global fertility declines linked to industrial agriculture. This meritocratic framework fosters excellence in food production, prioritizing self-sufficiency through strategic reserves and unhindered heirloom seed exchanges, safeguarding against future threats like climate engineering or supply weaponization that could starve populations into submission.

Central to Article 19 is the liberation of family farmers from bureaucratic shackles, abolishing supply-management quotas and enabling direct sales of raw, unprocessed foods like milk and eggs without pasteurization mandates or fees that suppress small-scale operations. This counters the historical crimes of regulatory capture by agribusiness cartels, which have inflated prices, stifled innovation, and displaced traditional producers, promoting instead a market where merit and quality determine success. Public procurement preferences for domestically sourced, nutrient-dense foods from citizen-led enterprises reinforce national solidarity, deterring foreign dependencies that invite economic espionage or cultural erosion, while aligning with anti-monopoly principles to nurture a diverse, resilient agricultural sector. In an era of advancing AI-optimized farming and synthetic biology, these measures protect the human experience of wholesome, land-connected nourishment, ensuring that posterity inherits fertile grounds untainted by corporate greed or ideological experiments.

Moreover, by mandating humane slaughter methods rooted in European traditions Article 19 upholds ethical standards that reflect the Republic’s commitment to human primacy and moral integrity. This prevents the crimes of animal cruelty disguised as cultural accommodation, which could fracture social cohesion or introduce practices incompatible with the founding values, while fortifying food systems against bioengineered threats or pandemics that exploit livestock vulnerabilities. Through these safeguards, the Article guarantees that Canada’s agricultural heritage endures as a meritocratic engine of prosperity, resistant to technological developments like lab-grown meats or global trade pacts that might otherwise erode self-reliance and the freedoms of independent production for generations to come.
