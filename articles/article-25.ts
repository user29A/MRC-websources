1.     Geoengineering and weather or climate modification in any form are permanently prohibited over Canadian territory or by Canadian entities anywhere. This includes but is not limited to:
      a)     stratospheric aerosol injection, marine cloud brightening, space-based solar reflection, or any artificial solar-radiation modification;
      b)     cloud seeding, hail suppression (except as permitted below), rain enhancement, fog dispersal, or any release of chemical, biological, or electromagnetic agents intended to alter precipitation, temperature, or atmospheric conditions;
      c)     high-energy radio-frequency, laser, or directed-energy systems designed to modify weather systems;
      d)     large-scale carbon-capture-and-storage technologies (chemical, biological, mechanical, or otherwise), excepting natural soil sequestration through traditional or regenerative farming practices.

2.     Any geoengineering activity wherever conducted, including but not limited to international waters, airspace, space, or the territory of another state, that is verifiably intended to or does materially alter weather, climate, sunlight, precipitation, or atmospheric conditions over any part of the territory, exclusive economic zone, or continental shelf of the Republic of Canada shall be deemed an act of aggression against the Canadian people. The Prime Minister is authorised to respond with all necessary military force, up to and including pre-emptive or retaliatory strikes against the responsible platforms, vessels, aircraft, installations, or command centres, without need for prior declaration of war or approval of any foreign or supranational body.

3.     Provincial authorities may authorise temporary, localised hail-suppression or tornado-dissipation operations using established, non-persistent agents (e.g., silver iodide flares) only when a specific, imminent, and severe storm threatens a major population centre or critical infrastructure, and only for the duration of that immediate threat. Every such operation must be publicly announced 24 hours in advance or immediately if urgency forbids, live-streamed when possible, independently monitored, and fully reported to the provincial legislature within seven days. Any use outside these strict limits shall be punished as treason.

4.     The Ministry of National Defence may conduct research, development, and deployment of geoengineering or weather modification technologies solely for defensive countermeasure purposes, strictly limited to neutralising verified hostile geoengineering acts by foreign adversaries that threaten Canadian territory, citizens, or military operations. Such activities:
      a)     must be authorised in advance by the Prime Minister upon recommendation of the Minister of National Defence, based on clear and present evidence of foreign aggression;
      b)     shall be confined to the minimum scope, duration, and intensity necessary to counteract the specific threat, with no residual or proactive environmental impact permitted beyond the immediate defensive objective;
      c)     are subject to annual independent review by a merit-selected special tribunal convened under the provisions of Article 2 (Freedom of Inquiry and Redress), comprising anonymised experts in environmental science, meteorology, and national security, who shall verify compliance with this exception and recommend termination if merit-based criteria are not met;
      d)     may never be delegated to private entities, foreign partners, or supranational organisations, and all records shall remain classified except for declassification after 25 years or upon tribunal determination that public disclosure serves the meritocratic interest without compromising security.
      Any violation of these limits, including unauthorised research or offensive use, shall be punished as high treason under Article 28.

5.     Each province shall establish and maintain a Ministry of Environment vested with exclusive jurisdiction over:
      a)     issuance and management of hunting, fishing, and trapping licences and seasons;
      b)     classification, protection, and active recovery of endangered or threatened native species;
      c)     setting and enforcement of air- and water-quality standards throughout the province, including industrial emissions, urban air pollution, and agricultural runoff;
      d)     oversight of waste collection, recycling, treatment, and disposal (including hazardous and medical waste);
      e)     remediation of contaminated sites and brownfields;
      f)     establishment of bounties where necessary for invasive or overpopulated species;
      g)     management of public forests, parks, and wilderness areas. Municipalities may enact stricter local standards but may never relax those set by the provincial ministry.

6.     The Republic recognises the vital contribution of healthy wildlands, forests, rivers, mountains, and abundant native flora and fauna to the physical, spiritual, and economic well-being of its citizens. Provinces shall exercise their authority over natural resources and wildlife management in a manner that promotes the long-term vitality, diversity, and sustainable abundance of native species and ecosystems, consistent with merit-proven scientific understanding and the European heritage of responsible dominion over the land.
      The national government shall support provincial efforts through coordination on transboundary species (including migratory birds and aquatic life), management of the National Domain for ecological integrity and public access, and deployment of sovereign wealth fund resources for merit-based restoration projects that enhance wildlife habitat, resilience against invasive threats, and opportunities for citizens to engage with nature.
      Hunting, fishing, and trapping for sustenance, recreation, or management shall remain honoured traditions, regulated to ensure thriving populations and fair access for competent citizens.

7.     No province may delegate, privatise, or transfer the core regulatory powers listed in this Article to any non-governmental or international entity.

8.     All subsoil resources, hydrocarbons, and strategic minerals within the territory of the Republic are the inalienable patrimony of the Canadian people and their posterity. No foreign person, foreign state, or corporation more than ten percent foreign-owned may ever acquire outright ownership of mineral rights or hold resource-extraction leases longer than twenty-five years. All resource revenues, after reasonable production costs, accrue exclusively to the sovereign wealth fund created under Article 22 for the equal benefit of citizens.

Article 25 asserts environmental and resource sovereignty as essential to the Meritocratic Republic of Canada, embodying the European settlers’ legacy of responsible stewardship over the vast northern landscapes they cultivated into a sustainable homeland. In an era where supranational entities and technological hubris threaten to weaponize the atmosphere through geoengineering such as aerosol injections or cloud seeding that could disrupt agriculture, fertility, and ecosystems, this provision permanently prohibits such modifications, securing nature’s natural cycles and preventing crimes like drought manipulation that could be used to control populations or induce scarcity. By deeming foreign geoengineering acts as aggression warranting military response, it upholds national self-defense, countering existential perils amplified by satellite technologies or directed-energy systems that could impose artificial famines or climatic disruptions, ensuring that meritocratic prosperity thrives on genuine environmental stability rather than manipulation.

Central to Article 25 is the devolution of environmental governance to provinces, empowering merit-selected ministries to manage wildlife, pollution, and habitats with science-based rigor, while prohibiting delegation to private or international bodies that might prioritize profit over posterity. This framework prevents crimes such as ecological sabotage through invasive species neglect or industrial contamination, promoting instead positive environmental management via bounties, restorations, and sustainable practices that enhance biodiversity and human vitality. The recognition of wildlands’ role in spiritual and economic well-being fosters a society where competent citizens engage with nature through honored traditions like hunting, free from bureaucratic overreach or foreign encroachments that erode cultural continuity, addressing contemporary threats like biotech-engineered invasives or global carbon schemes that commodify the environment.

Furthermore, by declaring subsoil resources the inalienable patrimony of the people, with strict limits on foreign ownership and revenues directed to a sovereign wealth fund, Article 25 safeguards economic liberty against the perils of resource plunder that have impoverished nations in the past, ensuring intergenerational equity for European posterity. This merit-based approach fortifies the Republic against future tyrannies from monopolies that might exploit minerals for supranational control, preserving the human experience of freedom in a world of converging technologies where environmental sovereignty is the ultimate bulwark against demographic and cultural erosion.
