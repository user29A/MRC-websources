  "content": "The sole purpose of courts is to punish the guilty and protect the innocent.\n\n1.     Every accused person is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt by an impartial jury of their peers. No person shall be compelled to testify against himself, nor deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\n\n2.     Mandatory minimum sentences shall apply to all serious violent crimes and to all crimes of child sexual exploitation, rape, murder, armed robbery, and treason.\n\n3.     No person convicted of the above offences may ever be released before serving the full term.\n\n4.     The judiciary is independent.\n      a)     Supreme-court judges are appointed by the Prime Minister from a shortlist of three candidates per vacancy proposed by a non-partisan Judicial Appointments Commission composed of five senior judges, three citizens chosen by lot from the National Registry of Citizens, and two members of the House chosen by lot. Judges serve until mandatory retirement at age 75 and may be removed only by a two-thirds vote of the House for proven misbehaviour or incapacity.\n      b)     Appointments to the superior courts of each province remain within provincial jurisdiction. Each province must establish a non-partisan Judicial Appointments Commission for these appointments, structured to mirror the federal commission in composition and function: five senior provincial judges, three citizens selected by lot from the provincial electorate from the National Registry of Citizens, and two members of the provincial legislature selected by lot.\n             For each vacancy, the commission shall propose a shortlist of three qualified candidates ranked by merit. The provincial premier shall appoint one from this shortlist.\n             Provincial superior court judges serve until mandatory retirement at age 75. Removal occurs only by a two-thirds vote of the provincial legislature for proven misbehaviour or incapacity.\n      c)     Members of the Judicial Appointments Commissions, whether federal or provincial, who serve in their capacity as senior judges or as members of the House or provincial legislature, receive no additional compensation beyond their existing salaries. Citizen members selected by lot receive full reimbursement of any wages lost during the period of service, plus a daily honorarium equal to twice the national median daily wage. Each commission convenes only for the time required to evaluate candidates and produce the mandated shortlist for the vacancy or vacancies under consideration, never to exceed four weeks.\n\n5.     Any judge, parole board member, prosecutor, or official who orders or facilitates the early release (or imposes manifestly inadequate sentence) on a violent offender who then reoffends shall themselves be prosecuted as an accessory before the fact and imprisoned for a term no less than that of the subsequent crime.\n\n6.     The death penalty is restored for premeditated murder, child rape, high treason, and for extreme, provably intentional financial, medical, religious, or scientific fraud that directly causes widespread death or irreversible ruin, upon unanimous jury verdict beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n7.     All executions shall be carried out solely by firing squad within seven days of final sentencing.\n\n8.     The criminal justice system of the Republic exists first to protect the innocent and second to restore the offender to productive citizenship where possible through evidence-based rehabilitation.\n      a)     Rehabilitation programmes shall employ psychological, educational, vocational, and medical modalities proven effective by rigorous outcome studies.\n      b)     Early release on parole may be granted only upon unanimous recommendation of a Rehabilitation Review Board and only after the offender has served at least two-thirds of the sentence, demonstrated genuine remorse, completed rehabilitative programmes, and posed no foreseeable risk to public safety. Any breach of parole conditions results in immediate return to custody to serve the full original term, plus additional penalties for deception and from any position of trust or authority.\n      c)     The death penalty or irrevocable life imprisonment without parole remains mandatory when a special Rehabilitation Review Board (composed of three senior judges, three forensic psychologists, and three citizen members chosen by lot) unanimously determines, after no fewer than seven years of observed behaviour and treatment, that the offender remains an incurable danger to human life. Such determination must be reviewed and reaffirmed every five years thereafter.\n      d)     No offender may ever be released if there exists any reasonable doubt about public safety. The protection of the innocent is the supreme law.",
  "precis": "Article 15 redefines the judiciary and public safety in the Meritocratic Republic of Canada as instruments dedicated to ensuring swift, certain punishment for the guilty while upholding the inviolable rights of the innocent, rooted in the European legal traditions of accountability and moral order that have sustained civilized societies. In a world where judicial leniency toward repeat offenders has allowed dangerous criminals to prey on communities with impunity, this provision introduces groundbreaking merit-based reforms by imposing mandatory minimum sentences for violent crimes such as child exploitation, rape, murder, and treason, directly addressing the failures of ideological bias and bureaucratic inefficiency that have eroded public safety. By holding judges, parole boards, and officials personally liable through fines, imprisonment, or civil damages for early releases or lenient decisions that result in recidivism, it secures the fundamental freedom of citizens to live without the constant threat of victimization, protecting the citizenry’s right to cultural and physical continuity against the rising criminality exacerbated by recent demographic shifts and soft-on-crime policies.\n\nCore to Article 15 is the restoration of the death penalty for premeditated murder, child rape, high treason, and intentional fraud causing widespread harm, executed swiftly by firing squad to deter heinous acts and affirm the Republic’s commitment to human primacy and the protection of innocents above all. This accountability framework prevents crimes like recidivism and judicial negligence, as evidenced by rigorous review boards that prohibit releases amid any doubt of rehabilitation, countering historical pitfalls where repeat offenders have been unleashed on society due to misplaced compassion or political agendas. The emphasis on evidence-based rehabilitation using psychological, educational, vocational, and medical modalities promotes meritocratic redemption for those capable of reform, fostering a society where competence and genuine change contribute to national strength, while irrevocable isolation or execution for irredeemable threats ensures that merit-driven justice prevails over sentimentality, addressing modern perils such as biotechnological enhancements that could amplify criminal capabilities.\n\nFurthermore, by mandating presumption of innocence, jury trials beyond reasonable doubt, and prohibitions against self-incrimination, Article 15 fortifies the Republic against future tyrannies amplified by AI surveillance, genetic engineering, or digital forensics that might be manipulated to subvert due process. This comprehensive approach preserves the European heritage of rational, humane law that values life and liberty, ensuring that posterity inherits a secure meritocracy where innovation thrives free from the shadows of unchecked violence or judicial corruption."
