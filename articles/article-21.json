  "content": "1.     Every human being present on Canadian soil, whether citizen, resident, or visitor, possesses the inviolable right to immediate emergency medical care of the highest merit-evaluated standard of care, as determined by the Medical Price and Practice Board based on proven, evidence-based protocols, necessary to preserve life or prevent permanent disability in cases of accidental injury, acute medical crisis, or the natural process of childbirth.\n\n2.     All non-emergency medical treatment, all treatment of chronic or lifestyle-related conditions, and all ongoing pharmaceutical or therapeutic care shall be the sole responsibility of the individual and shall be obtained through private insurance or direct payment.\n\n3.     Every Canadian citizen from the moment of conception until the age of eighteen, and every citizen of any age suffering from a verified congenital or unavoidable medical condition requiring continuous treatment for survival or basic function, shall receive full medical coverage without premium or co-payment, funded by the state.\n\n4.     The medical insurance industry shall operate under strict oversight to prevent price gouging, denial of legitimate claims, or unnecessary delay or withholding of covered treatment. Any insurer found guilty of systematic abuse of patients or inflationary practices shall have its licence permanently revoked and its officers held personally liable.\n\n5.     Providers of medical goods and services (physicians, surgeons, hospitals, clinics, pharmaceutical manufacturers, medical-device companies, diagnostic laboratories, and any other entity billing for health-related products or services) are likewise subject to strict oversight by an independent Medical Price and Practice Board. Prohibited practices include, but are not limited to:\n      a)     price gouging or collusive pricing above reasonable cost-plus-fair-profit margins as determined annually by the Board;\n      b)     refusal to publish transparent, all-in pricing in advance of treatment;\n      c)     balance-billing patients beyond published prices;\n      d)     tying or bundling of services to force purchase of unnecessary procedures or products;\n      e)     paying or receiving kickbacks, referral fees, or any inducement for patient steering.\n      Violation by any licensed provider or corporate officer shall result in permanent loss of licence to practise or sell in the Republic, personal fines of up to ten times the illicit gain, and imprisonment for repeat or egregious offences.\n\n6.     The Medical Price and Practice Board shall be composed of nine members appointed for non-renewable ten-year terms: three senior physicians chosen by blind lot from a registry of practising doctors, three citizen members chosen by lot from the National Registry of Citizens, and three independent actuaries or health economists nominated by the Supreme Court. The Board shall publish annual reference prices for common procedures, pharmaceuticals, and devices, and conduct random audits of providers and insurers. Deliberate falsification of records or obstruction of audits is punishable by permanent professional disqualification and imprisonment.\n\n7.     Generic pharmaceuticals shall be priced at no more than reference international lows plus a fixed reasonable margin set by the Board. Patent abuse, evergreening, or pay-for-delay schemes are prohibited as crimes against public health.\n\n8.     No medical provider, insurer, or state authority may ever link medical treatment decisions to end-of-life directives, organ-donation status, or any non-medical criterion. Coerced organ harvesting or presumption of consent for tissue donation is prohibited as a crime of force against the person.",
  "precis": "Article 21 establishes a balanced, meritocratic health system in the Meritocratic Republic of Canada, providing universal emergency care while placing non-emergency treatment under individual responsibility, avoiding the pitfalls of universal socialized medicine that foster dependency, price inflation, and ideological capture. This provision ensures universal access to life-saving emergency care while relegating non-critical treatments to private means, securing the freedom of personal choice in wellness without subsidizing lifestyle excesses that drain public resources. By providing full coverage for children up to eighteen and those with unavoidable conditions from conception onward, it upholds positive eugenics by investing in the vitality of future generations, particularly the European-descended majority, preventing the crimes of neglect that exacerbate demographic decline and cultural erosion seen in modern welfare states. This framework counters the perils of socialized medicine that have led to rationing, waitlists, and coerced interventions, promoting instead a system where merit-driven innovation thrives through competitive, transparent markets unburdened by overregulation.\n\nCentral to Article 21 is the rigorous oversight of insurers and providers via the Medical Price and Practice Board, which deters crimes like price gouging, kickbacks, and fraudulent denials through permanent licence revocations and personal liabilities, ensuring that medical excellence serves the people rather than profiteers. Reference pricing for generics and prohibitions on opaque billing foster affordability and accountability, addressing historical abuses where pharmaceutical cartels have inflated costs to exploit vulnerabilities, while protocols for human tissues prioritize verifiable consent. By classifying coerced organ harvesting as a severe offense under judicial penalties, it protects bodily integrity and prevents the commodification of life that has emerged in global black markets, reinforcing the Republic’s commitment to human primacy and ethical merit in healthcare decisions that honor the European heritage of rational, compassionate governance.\n\nFurthermore, in anticipating future threats from biotechnologies like genetic editing or AI-diagnostic monopolies that could enable surveillance or selective culling, Article 21 fortifies freedoms through independent audits and merit-evaluated protocols, ensuring that medical advancements enhance rather than undermine the human experience of autonomy. This preserves the cultural continuity of European posterity by barring presumptive consent schemes or linkages to end-of-life decisions, resilient amid emerging vectors of tyranny such as digital health passports or engineered pandemics. In doing so, the Article guarantees a meritocracy where health serves as a foundation for national strength, protecting generations from the distortions of supranational health agendas or corporate overreach that threaten liberty."
