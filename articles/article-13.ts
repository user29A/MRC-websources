  title: "Structure of Government",
  content: `
The Republic of Canada shall be governed by a simple, transparent, and meritocratic system designed for the 21st century and beyond. Permanent political parties, whipped votes, and hereditary parliamentary theatrics are abolished. Government shall be conducted by individual citizens of proven character and competence who are directly accountable to the people at all times.

1.     The Legislature shall be unicameral and named the House of the Republic. It shall consist of exactly 333 members. Members shall serve terms of six years. Elections shall be held on fixed dates every two years for one-third of the seats (111 members), with the seats divided into three equal cohorts serving staggered terms. At the first election following ratification, the cohorts shall be assigned initial terms of two, four, or six years by lot to establish the staggered cycle; thereafter, all successful candidates shall serve full six-year terms.

2.     Elections shall be by first-past-the-post in single-member ridings of roughly equal population. No party lists, no proportional representation, no preferential voting, and no reserved seats. Every member stands as an individual citizen, not as a delegate of a party.

3.     Political parties are not recognised in law. No public funding, no tax status, no official party whips, no party names on ballots, and no party discipline enforced by the Speaker. Candidates may describe themselves however they wish, but the ballot shall list only the candidate’s personal name and riding.

4.     The head of government shall be the Prime Minister of the Republic, directly elected by the whole people in a national two-round system at the same fixed election dates as the House cohorts. If no candidate obtains 50 % + 1 in the first round, a run-off between the top two is held two weeks later. The Prime Minister shall serve a term of six years, aligned with the full staggered cycle of the House.

5.     The Prime Minister:
      a)     appoints and dismisses ministers (who need not be members of the House),
      b)     is commander-in-chief,
      c)     negotiates and ratifies treaties (subject to two-thirds approval of the House),
      d)     may veto legislation (veto override requires a three-quarters vote of the House),
      e)     may dissolve the House and call early elections once per term if the budget or supply bill fails twice. The Prime Minister may not introduce legislation or vote in the House.

6.     Ministers are individually responsible to the House. Any minister may be removed by a simple majority vote of no confidence on a motion that names the minister personally. The Prime Minister must dismiss that minister within 48 hours.

7.     The House may remove the Prime Minister by a constructive vote of no confidence: a three-quarters majority that simultaneously names a replacement Prime Minister who is immediately sworn in. This power may be used only once per term.

8.     Question Period is abolished in its current theatrical form. Instead, every Wednesday the Prime Minister and every minister shall appear in person before the House for a maximum of three hours of direct, unscripted questioning by any member. Questions are limited to two minutes; answers to four minutes. No points of order, no props, no applause, no prepared talking points. The Speaker’s role is time-keeping and enforcing basic decorum. Sessions are live-streamed and permanently archived. The Speaker shall have the authority to enforce decorum by the following measures, applied progressively:
            i)      verbal warning;
           ii)     deduction of the member’s remaining question or answer time in that session;
          iii)    temporary expulsion from the chamber for the remainder of the day’s sitting;
           iv)     in cases of repeated or egregious violation, suspension of the member’s right to pose questions for up to four consecutive Wednesdays.
      All disciplinary actions shall be recorded in the minutes and published immediately. Appeals against the Speaker’s ruling may be made to the full House, but only by written motion requiring a two-thirds vote to overturn.

9.     All votes in the House are recorded by name and published within one hour. There is no secret ballot for any legislative matter.

10.    Members of the House may not serve simultaneously as ministers or as provincial legislators. Members receive a salary fixed at twice the national median wage and are subject to immediate recall by petition of ten percent of their riding’s electors (Article 12, section 2).

11.    The provinces retain exclusive jurisdiction over education, health, municipal institutions, property and civil rights, natural resources within their boundaries, and all matters of a purely local or private nature. All residual powers belong to the national government. No concurrent powers exist except where explicitly stated in this Constitution.

12.    The judiciary is independent. Superior-court judges are appointed by the Prime Minister from a shortlist of three candidates per vacancy proposed by a non-partisan Judicial Appointments Commission composed of five senior judges, three citizens chosen by lot, and two members of the House chosen by lot. Judges serve until mandatory retirement at age 75 and may be removed only by a two-thirds vote of the House for proven misbehaviour or incapacity.

13.    The Speaker of the House is elected by secret ballot of the members at the opening of each new House cohort cycle and serves for six years. The Speaker may not be removed except by a two-thirds vote for cause.

14.    All other rules and procedures for the consideration and enactment of legislation shall be determined by the House of the Republic in standing orders adopted and amendable by simple majority vote of its members.

Article 13 delineates the structure of government in the Meritocratic Republic of Canada, establishing a streamlined, accountable system that rejects the antiquated theatrics of hereditary parliaments and permanent political parties, which have historically bred corruption, gridlock, and detachment from the people’s will. This framework ensures that power resides with individuals of demonstrated merit and character, directly elected and perpetually answerable to the European-descended citizenry who form the nation’s core. By abolishing whipped votes, party lists, and proportional representation, it secures the freedom of independent representation, allowing legislators to prioritize excellence and national interest over factional loyalties, thus preventing the crimes of political machine manipulation and voter disenfranchisement that have eroded trust in modern democracies. This unicameral House of 333 members, elected in single-riding contests, fosters genuine debate and decision-making, safeguarding the cultural continuity and prosperity envisioned by the founders.

At its foundation, Article 13 empowers a directly elected Prime Minister with robust executive authority, including veto powers and treaty ratification, balanced by legislative checks such as constructive no-confidence votes and ministerial accountability, which counteract the perils of executive overreach seen in recent global crises. This separation ensures meritocratic selection through national run-off elections, where competence trumps charisma or party backing, while provisions for recall and transparent questioning sessions prevent crimes like abuse of office, nepotism, and unaccountable secrecy that plague bureaucratic states. By limiting concurrent powers and reserving residual authority to the national government, it maintains federal unity without diluting provincial sovereignty over local matters, addressing historical tensions in Canada’s European-settled regions and promoting efficient administration that values human agency over algorithmic or supranational control.

Article 13 fortifies the Republic against future threats from technological convergence, such as programmable voting systems or cyber-influenced elections, by mandating live-streamed transparency, recorded votes, and non-partisan judicial appointments that uphold impartial justice. This merit-driven design protects the freedoms of self-governance and cultural integrity for posterity, ensuring that the European heritage of innovation and liberty endures amid advancing AI governance tools or corporate encroachments, allowing citizens to thrive in a system where excellence, not entitlement, defines service.
