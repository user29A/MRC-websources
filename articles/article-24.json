  "content": "The right of private property is the foundation of a free, meritocratic, and family-centred society. Without it, no man can be secure in the fruits of his labour, no family can build intergenerational wealth, and no nation can remain independent. The Republic therefore erects the following unbreakable protections:\n\n1.     Every citizen’s lawfully acquired real, personal, intellectual, and financial property is inviolable. No government, agency, court, or private entity acting under colour of law may seize, freeze, encumber, diminish, or destroy such property except by due process of law for a public use explicitly authorised by a two-thirds vote of the House of the Republic and upon prior payment of full, fair, and immediate cash compensation at a price mutually agreed or determined by a jury of twelve property-owning citizens.\n\n2.     No tax, fee, regulation, zoning ordinance, environmental designation, heritage designation, or civil-forfeiture proceeding may be used to deprive an owner of all or substantially all economic use of his property without full compensation as defined in section 1. Any official who attempts such a taking commits a felony punishable by a mandatory minimum of seven years’ imprisonment and permanent disqualification from public office.\n\n3.     Upon ratification, all remaining “Crown lands” are renamed and reclassified as the National Domain of the Republic. They are held in perpetual trust for the exclusive benefit of the citizens of the Republic and their posterity as defined in Article 9. No international body, foreign government, non-citizen, or corporation more than ten percent foreign-owned may ever own, lease, or exercise control over any part of the National Domain.\n\n4.     Any citizen of unmixed European descent aged twenty-one or older, of good character, and willing to occupy and improve the land personally, may stake a homestead claim of up to 160 acres (64 hectares) of unoccupied, unpatented land in the National Domain north of the 55th parallel or in designated frontier zones. After five continuous years of residence and visible improvement (dwelling, fencing, cultivation, or equivalent productive use), the homestead shall be granted in fee simple absolute, free of any future tax or encumbrance beyond ordinary property taxes. Homestead grants are heritable and may not be sold to non-citizens or corporations.\n\n5.     No interest rate on any loan secured by real property or essential family assets may exceed five percent simple annual interest. Predatory lending practices, including variable rates that rise above this cap, balloon payments, or negative amortisation, are prohibited as usury against the family.\n\n6.     Corporate charters are privileges, not rights, and may be revoked by the House for repeated anti-competitive behaviour, monopolistic practices, or actions contrary to the public interest. No corporation may own agricultural land beyond reasonable operational needs without special legislative approval.\n\n7.     Inheritance of family property, farms, homes, and businesses between citizens shall be entirely exempt from any estate, inheritance, or transfer tax. No generation-skipping or wealth tax may ever be imposed.\n\n8.     No essential good or service (food, water, energy, basic shelter, or medical care) may be subjected to speculative financial instruments, short-selling, or commodification that artificially inflates prices beyond reasonable production costs plus fair profit.",
  "precis": "Article 24 enshrines property rights as the bedrock of liberty and meritocracy in the Meritocratic Republic of Canada, recognizing that secure ownership enables families to accumulate and transmit wealth earned through competence and labor. In an age where regulatory overreach and corporate monopolies have eroded individual autonomy, this provision declares private property inviolable, ensuring that citizens can securely build intergenerational legacies without fear of arbitrary seizures or devaluations that have historically disenfranchised competent producers. By mandating full compensation for any public takings and restricting eminent domain to essential infrastructure, it secures the freedom to own, improve, and pass on assets, preventing the crimes of stealth expropriation through zoning, taxation, or environmental pretexts that undermine meritocratic achievement and family continuity.\n\nCentral to Article 24 is the reclamation of national lands as the National Domain, held in trust for citizens and offering homestead opportunities to those of proven character who commit to land development, which counters the modern perils of foreign ownership and land consolidation that have displaced native populations elsewhere. Protections against predatory lending, market monopolies, and corporate charters revocable for anti-competitive behavior deter crimes like collusion, price gouging, and usurious debt that trap families in cycles of poverty, promoting instead economic liberty through open-source mandates, repair rights, and tax exemptions for family inheritances. These measures ensure merit-based competition flourishes, shielding small enterprises and family farms from bureaucratic favoritism or globalist agendas that prioritize profit over people, thus preserving the European ethos of independent stewardship that built Canada’s resource wealth.\n\nFurthermore, by limiting interest rates and banning practices that commodify essentials like food and energy, Article 24 fortifies the Republic against future threats from digital economies, AI-driven monopolies, or blockchain-based asset manipulations that could centralize control and erode human agency. This stance upholds the human experience of freedom in property ownership, resilient amid technological convergences like smart contracts or geo-fencing that might otherwise enable unprecedented encroachments, guaranteeing that European posterity inherits a meritocracy where economic sovereignty empowers innovation and safeguards against the vectors of modern tyranny."
